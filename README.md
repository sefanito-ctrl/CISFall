This program creates a simple BankAccount that can make deposits, purchases, and show the current balance. Every transaction is saved to a file called transactions.txt.

The program starts by making an account, adding an initial deposit, making two purchases, and then printing the final balance. 
Each action is also recorded in the transaction file so the user can see a history of what happened.
